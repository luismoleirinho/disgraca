                <p class="item-1">Disgraça is an anti-authoritarian, horizontally organized, DIY social centre located
                    on Rua Penha de França in Lisbon which has been running since 2015. For a lot of people Disgraça is
                    a place to come to boogie down and hear their favorite bands and enjoy delicious vegan meals but at
                    Disgraça there is much more going on!
                    It’s a place for building community, mutual aid and organizing diverse struggles, from the broader
                    anti-fascist fight to the local housing crises. It’s a space where you can just hangout or you can
                    get involved. A place to be used as a tool and to create bonds in the long fight against the
                    status-quo, authoritarianism, Capital and the State, while challenging racism, homophobia,
                    transphobia, sexism or any vertical animal nonsense that gets in the way.</p>

                <p class="item-2">Disgraça has four floors of fun with loads of different spaces and forever unfinished
                    projects.
                    Up top there’s Tortuga, the anarchist bookshop, which also has T-shirts and music plus a free food
                    shop. Below there is the Freeshop, BOESG library and a screenprinting workshop available for all
                    sorts of stuff.
                    Then there is the canteen; where all the black magic happens. World famous in Lisbon, the 100% plant
                    based food at Disgraça is considered by just so many to be one of the best in town and is without a
                    doubt one of the cheapest (because it’s donation ;) ). The secret? Well, there are no well kept
                    secrets here except that anyone is welcome to share their tasty skills and learn new ones. Show up.
                    We'll hand you a knife.</p>

                <p class="item-3">A variety of radical films and documentaries are shown in the cinema room or dining
                    space where also benefit events are held to support local and international causes.
                    Down below is the concert space where along with some great DIY international names many acts have
                    had their first gig. At Disgraça all gigs have sliding scale prices, all the money goes to the
                    bands' traveling costs, and like the rest of the space it’s open to all ages. Along with the concert
                    space there’s also a rehearsal room & recording studio available to DIY and lesser known groups and
                    artists. Right next to it we have our own workshop where we do all sorts of crafty stuff and we're
                    also in the midst of building a gym open the community, for self defense training and other
                    activities.</p>
